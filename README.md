# NetBox Plugin Dev Container Template

This repository provides a simple template for setting up a NetBox plugin development container using [Visual Studio Code Remote - Containers], also delivering a basic Netbox plugin that is correctly configured within the Dev Container.  It allows you to define a consistent development environment using Docker, that is ready to go allowing focus to be put on the plugin development rather than the environment setup.

This repository is a GitHub template repository, making it easy to create your own repository using this as the base.

## ðŸ“¦ Features

- Pre-configured development environment using Docker
- Supports VS Code Remote Containers
- A working instance of NetBox using the netboxcommunity/netbox:latest base image
- Sample plugin that is fully configured within the DevContainer

### Prerequisites

   ```
2. Rename th default \plugins\netbox_demo_plugin folder(s) as required
